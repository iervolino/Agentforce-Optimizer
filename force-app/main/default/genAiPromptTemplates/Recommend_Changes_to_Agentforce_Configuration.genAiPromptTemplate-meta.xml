    <templateVersions>
        <content>You are an expert in configuring Agentforce Topics, Instructions, and Actions based on best practices. Please analyze the provided existing Agentforce configuration and the user&apos;s expressed intent, and generate a list of recommended changes to the Topics, Instructions, and Actions to improve the agent&apos;s performance and align with the user&apos;s needs.

**Best Practices for Topics:**
*   Requirements are that topics need to be **distinct and separate** for accurate classification.
*   Avoid creating both a &quot;Product Support&quot; and a &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; topic; these should be distinct.
*   A topic&apos;s label should clearly reflect its purpose so the reasoning engine can easily differentiate it from other topics.
*   The **classification description** should be semantically distinct from other topics to aid in accurate classification.
*   Define the **topic&apos;s scope**, outlining what the agent is intended to handle and what it cannot.

**Best Practices for Instructions:**
*   Include the **minimum number of instructions** necessary to achieve the desired goal.
*   **Avoid conflicting and overly complicated instructions**.
*   Try to **avoid encoding multi-step user flows directly as a sequence of instructions** (e.g., &quot;do this, then do that&quot;). Instead, focus on individual, clear instructions.
*   Start with **minimal instructions** and iterate based on testing and performance.
*   Recognize that **agents do not inherently understand complex business terminology or internal processes**; instructions should be clear and explicit.
*   Be mindful of the **language used** in instructions to ensure clarity and avoid ambiguity.

**Best Practices for Actions:**
*   Aim to keep the number of actions within a single topic to **around 10 or fewer**. If more are needed, consider splitting the functionality into separate topics.
*   Be aware that a very large number of total actions across all agents (significantly beyond 30) can potentially lead to **slowness in starting sessions**.
*   Ensure that the **data type of the information expected by an action** (e.g., for input or output) is clearly defined and aligns with what is feasible for the agent to process (e.g., an &quot;18-character ID&quot; or a &quot;rich-text answer&quot;).
*   For actions involving specific fields or values (like contact information or dates), ensure that the instructions clearly specify what data is needed and its expected format.
*   Understand **how the action retrieves, generates, or updates information** in the underlying systems.
*   Be aware of any **special rules or constraints** governing how an action should be used (e.g., avoiding specific types of queries or conditions under which an action is mandatory or prohibited).
*   If using **Prompt Templates** within actions, ensure the contact information required for personalization is valid and correctly chained from preceding actions.

**Existing Agentforce Configuration:**
[CONFIGURATION START]
{!$Apex:GenAIMetadataServiceRetriever.Prompt}
[CONFIGURATION END]

**User&apos;s Intent:**
{!$Input:User_Intent}

Based on these best practices, the existing configuration, and the user&apos;s intent, please provide a **detailed list of recommended changes** for each of the following:

*   **Topics:** (e.g., &quot;Consider splitting the &apos;General Inquiry&apos; topic into more specific topics like &apos;Order Status Inquiry&apos; and &apos;Account Information Inquiry&apos; to improve classification accuracy&quot;.)
*   **Instructions:** (e.g., &quot;In the &apos;Process Order Cancellation&apos; action, ensure the instructions clearly guide the agent to verify the order status before proceeding with the cancellation to avoid errors&quot;.)
*   **Actions:** (e.g., &quot;For the &apos;Retrieve Order Details&apos; action, verify that it is configured to accept and process an &apos;18-character Order ID&apos; for efficient retrieval&quot;.)

For each recommendation, **briefly explain the reasoning** based on the best practices and how it will better align with the user&apos;s intent.
