# Agentforce Optimizer

Agentforce Optimizer is a Salesforce DX project that helps validate and enhance Agentforce configurations to improve agent performance. It checks your setup against best practices across topics, instructions, and actions, and offers tailored recommendations for optimization.

# üîç What It Does

This tool automates the validation and optimization process for Agentforce configurations (Topics, Instructions and Actions).

Key capabilities include:

- Verifying configurations against best practices
- Highlighting potential issues and opportunities for optimization

# üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
The project leverages a configurable Prompt Template (named Validate Agentforce Configurations) available through Prompt Builder. This template drives the validation logic and can be extended to support evolving use cases or business requirements.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
The current version of the Optimizer leverages the custom GenAIMetadataServiceRetriever to retrieve agent configurations. At this stage, it is limited to fetching custom topics that include associated instructions and actions, with the action data restricted to the action name only.
